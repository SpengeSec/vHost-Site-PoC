<h4>
      Proof of Concept:
    </h4>
    <p>Please keep in mind the following is just an <b>example</b> and demonstration of how the script I've written could be used. With no regard to error handling and input validation.</p><br>
    <p>First an end-user navigates to your index.html.</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/front.png">
    <p>When navigating to the hosting page a customer is greeted with the following:</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/hosting.png">
    <p>The end-user fills in their details along with the domain to be registered.</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/hosting_filled_in.png">
    <p>Upon pressing the Register button, the data filled into the form is handled by a PHP script.</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/execute_php.png">
    <p>On the front end, the customer is shown a confirmation page.</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/webspace_created.png">
    <p>The virtual host has now been created successfully along with the user account.</p>
    <img width="100%" src="img/vhost_site/domain.png">
    <p>If an FTP service is installed and configured the end-user can also access its files through FTP.</p>
